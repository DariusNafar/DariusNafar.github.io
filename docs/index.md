# Aliakbar Nafar


## Summary
PhD candidate in NLP and LLMs with NAACL 2025 Outstanding Paper. 5+ years building production LLM and neuro-symbolic AI models. Open-source project lead with 12+ cross-institution collaborators. Specialty in in-context learning, reasoning, and evaluation.


## Current Projects

- Develop an agentic coding framework that can autonomously work with Python-based GitHub projects, even when documentation is sparse and bugs are present.
- Build an end-to-end benchmark for choosing neuro-symbolic AI frameworks that weighs both engineering effort and performance.
- Design an A/B testing framework to evaluate how prompt design influences user trust in AI.

# Aliakbar Nafar


## Summary
PhD in NLP and LLMs with NAACL 2025 Outstanding Paper. 5+ years building production LLM and neuro-symbolic AI models. Open-source project lead with 12+ cross-institution collaborators. Specialty in fine-tuning \& training LLMs, in-context learning \& reasoning.

## Current Projects

- Build an interactive agentic coder with LangGraph, FastAPI, and RAG to generate and debug code to fine-tune collaborative LLMs using reinforcement learning.
- Design an A/B testing framework to evaluate how prompt design influences user trust in AI.

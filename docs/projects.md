# Projects

Focus areas and tooling:

- Python, PyTorch, and FastAPI for research tooling and services
- BN learning/parameterization pipelines with LLM-derived priors
- Efficient LLM querying pipelines: batching, caching, and cost-aware prompting
- Reproducible experiment harnesses and dataset curation tools

Highlights (placeholders):

- BN-LLM Parameterizer — modular pipeline for integrating EDP/EPK evidence into BN parameter learning
- LLM Query Toolkit — utilities for robust, cached, and cost-efficient API usage
- FastAPI Microservices — research-serving endpoints for inference and evaluation

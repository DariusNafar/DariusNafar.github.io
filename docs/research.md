# Research

My research interests include:

- In-context learning for probabilistic estimation and inference
- LLM-derived priors and structural hints for Bayesian Networks (BNs)
- Parameter learning and calibration of BNs using LLM-generated evidence (e.g., EDP, EPK)
- Neuro-symbolic reasoning: combining logical structure with neural models
- AI trust, reliability, and evaluation under uncertainty

# Research

## Assess Trust and Relationship Building in Human-AI Interactions (Mar 2025 – Present)
- Design prompts, A/B testing framework, and full-stack agentic chatbot UI with FastAPI and LangChain to assess trust
- 2x user engagement and improve user task completion by 30% among 12 pilot users in phase 1 via optimal prompting strategy

## Learning vs Retrieval: The Role of In-Context Examples in Regression with LLMs (Jan 2024 – Dec 2024)
- Propose a framework to identify and manipulate Large Language Models' in-context learning (ICL) mechanisms
- Achieve data efficiency up to 90%, resulting in a publication in NAACL 2025 (Outstanding Paper Award)

## Reasoning over Uncertain Text by Generative Large Language Models (May 2023 – Jul 2025)
- Create Bayesian Inference Dataset. Prompt-engineer coding methods improve accuracy 40%, resulting in an AAAI 2025 publication
- Use LLMs to emulate expert probability judgments. Improve Bayesian Network accuracy by 7%. Submitted to AAAI 2026

## DomiKnowS: Integrating Symbolic Domain Knowledge in Deep Learning (Jan 2021 – Present)
- Research varying methods of constraint utilization and merge them into a library, resulting in an EMNLP 2021 Demo publication
- Build the first benchmark for evaluation of neuro-symbolic methods and embeddings, resulting in an AAAI 2023 publication
- Architect interactive deep learning coding pipeline (GPT-4) that boosted developer speed by 500%, published at NeSy 2024
- Design end-to-end benchmark for open-source NeSy frameworks quantifying engineering effort with system KPIs. Submitted to JAIR
